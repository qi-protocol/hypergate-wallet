To Infura and Beyond
$10,000 Prize Pool


Most Creative Multichain Deployment

 

Deploy your dapp using Infura’s RPC endpoints to at least two networks. Each deployment should utilize functionality and features unique to the networks chosen, and provide specific and applicable solutions. For a Bonus: integrate additional Infura solutions such as IPFS, Archive Data, Trace API, etc.

 

The more integration points with Infura the better but trivial use cases won’t get you much so make sure you are using each service in a meaningful way.

 

Requirements:

    GitHub repo
    A short demo video of your dapp
    README that includes: justification of endpoints used and links to the files that include the integration

IYKYK Linea Edition
$25,000 Prize Pool





Linea is an EVM-equivalent zk-rollup that scales your dapps with lower gas fees and faster transaction times using the developer tools you know like Truffle, Hardhat, and Foundry. Building on Ethereum is no different than building on Linea.


Additionally, it sits within the Consensys ecosystem, with a default integration in MetaMask, close collaboration with Besu, and an Infura-powered RPC. To be eligible for this bounty, all you need to do is deploy your smart contract on Linea!


Requirements:

    Deployment on Linea using Infura
    GitHub repo
    A short demo video of your dapp
    A link to your deployed smart contract on blockscout
    The Linea network configured in your Truffle, HardHat, or Foundry configuration
    README should detail what the project is, what it aims to accomplish, and steps to run it locally
    Projects must be able to be run locally when tested by our judges

OH SNAP!
$25,000 Prize Pool





Snaps is MetaMask’s extension system, allowing you to expand the capabilities of MetaMask by getting access to privileged APIs. With Snaps, you can implement non-EVM chains, give users transaction insights, and more.

 

To be eligible for the bounty, build any novel use-case with Snaps, such as adding a non-EVM chain to the wallet, increasing security through transaction insights, adding account abstraction capabilities, or implementing an identity/communication protocol.

Requirements:

    GitHub repository
    Create something that couldn’t be done without Snaps
    README file with instructions to test
    Judge must be able to successfully run your code locally
    A short demo video of your snap
