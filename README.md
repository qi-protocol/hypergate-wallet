# **Hypergate Wallet**: The Ultimate Hyper-Crosschain Wallet Solution üöÄ

Imagine a future where your grandma uses crypto to buy her favorite cookies, and she doesn't even realize it's powered by blockchain. Sounds like sci-fi, right? üåå

**Is this achievable?**  
Absolutely! But let's be real, we're still paving the yellow brick road to that future.

## **Where Are We Now?** üåç
We're surrounded by a myriad of L1s, innovative L1-L2 scaling solutions, and the budding world of ERC4337 (account abstraction). It's like being in a candy store with endless choices!

**But here's the twist:**  
1. üåÄ Interoperability is possible, but having a smooth chat between chains feels like trying to order a pizza in a language you don't speak. And if you want to make a move from your wallet to another chain? You better be ready for some bridge-trekking!
2. üöÄ Thinking one EVM blockchain can do it all? Remember the skyrocketing gas prices of Ethereum Mainnet in 2021? That's like expecting a single superhero to save the world every time. Different chains have their strengths, and it's all about leveraging them.
3. üåâ But, there's a catch! While we can shout across chains, it's like yelling across a canyon. If your money's on one side and you want to make magic on the other, you're in for a hike. Especially if you're into minting those shiny NFTs.

## **Enter Hypergate Wallet** üåü
It's not just another wallet. Think of it as your personal crypto wizard üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. It's a crosschain account abstraction wallet control system (phew, that's a mouthful!).

**What's the magic?**  
- ‚ú® Users craft their own wallets, sprinkling in features as they like.  
- ‚ú® Our system lets you whip up your own transactions. It's like baking ‚Äì but instead of adding chocolate chips or nuts, you're adding hooks and controls.  
- ‚ú® And the cherry on top? Our special crosschain paymaster system. It's like having a genie granting wishes on where, how, and from where you execute transactions.

**In a nutshell:** Hypergate Wallet is your ticket to a seamless, chain-agnostic crypto experience. So, are you ready to jump into the future? üöÄ

## Targeted Bounties:

Optimism is redistributing power to humanity through a low-cost, lightning-fast, Ethereum-equivalent L2 blockchain, OP Mainnet. It‚Äôs powered by the OP Stack: a standardized, modular, and open-source dev stack that enables interoperable chains. Together, these underpin the Superchain: a set of chains that all share a software stack and have the same security properties that enable them to communicate and work together.

üèä‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è¬†$5,000 Super Pool Prize
Deploy your app on OP Mainnet and Base and Zora, all three OP Chains in Superhack. The best five (determined by OP Labs) receive $1K each. Testnet deployments are also valid for each chain.



Base is a secure, low-cost, developer-friendly Ethereum-equivalent L2 blockchain built on the OP Stack by Coinbase. Our vision is to collectively work towards an ambitious goal: bring the next billion users onchain. Base is a founding participant in the Optimism Superchain and the second core developer of the OP Stack.

Account Abstraction: $6K
Join us in bringing the next cohort of users onchain. Provide a prototype of account abstraction that helps to simplify the user experience on Base. Deploy a project utilizing a paymaster based on specific user criteria, such as holding an NFT or previous onchain activity. Create a subscription service that is easier to consume and manage by being onchain.


Worldcoin¬†is building the world‚Äôs largest identity and financial network as a public utility, giving ownership to everyone. World ID is the protocol to bring global proof of personhood to the internet, built to be privacy-first, decentralized and self-custodial.

ANY


Zora L2 OP‚Ä®Winners
The 10 best projects deployed on Zora Network or built with Zora Protocols, regardless of category, will win a prize of $2,000.


Hyperlane‚Ä®ü•á¬†Best Use of Permissionless Interoperability: $4k USD
To be eligible for the prize, deploy Hyperlane on your own OP Chain! Give your OP Chain limitless connectivity with Hyperlane. The way you use your new interoperability capabilities will determine your chances of winning the grand prize. You could use Hyperlane to connect your OP Chain with any other and do something amazing! Once you‚Äôve connected your OP Chain, think about creative ways to build an Interchain Application, to leverage Warp Routes, or to create a unique bit of infrastructure. The most technically impressive and creative submission will win the grand prize.

üéº¬†Best Interchain Application: $2k USD
An interchain application is an application that communicates between different blockchains. It can either transfer assets or make interchain function calls. The winner of this prize will be the most impressive application that makes use of Hyperlane and benefits from its presence on multiple blockchains. This is a perfect opportunity to build a robust DeFi app as a unique OP Chain!


Mode is an OP Stack Layer-2 designed for hyper-growth. The Mode ecosystem is built with integrated tools to support developers with onboarding users and liquidity to grow their applications.
